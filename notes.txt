Class 7 (09/23/2025) [I know I saved this under 09/16/25; I was in too deep, apologies in advance].

Topic: Command Line, File Management, and GitHub

Objective: Upload sample files from your computer to a GitHub repo, using Git, Bash (Windows), or Terminal (Mac/Linux).

Notes:
1. For Windows, type "Git Bash" in the search. It is used to work directly with the computer. 

2. Type (pwd) [print working directory] if Theo asks where your pwd is. Tells you where you are on your computer/file.

3. (ls) gives you an overview/view of all the files.

4. Use (cd) to change your directory or files. 

5. Use (clear) to make your screen clear 

6. cd .. goes back to your original files

7. To start checking files, the best practice is:
> pwd (in the beginning there was print working directory shows where you are starting from) > ls (to list what is currently in your overview files) > cd (pick which file you want to go into from what you saw earlier in [ls]) > cd (pick your files then repeat process of [ls] list files, [cd] change directory, [ls] check again, [cd] change and pick if needed. 

8. to create a file type (touch)

9. to remove a file type (rm)

10. Save your new repository CLI:

echo "# 09.16.25" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/PCPreme/09.16.25.git
git push -u origin main
